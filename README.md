## Title: Command Line Interface

## Description
Creating a software engineering team generator command line application. After creating the command line, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on information provided.

## Solution
I first installed npm, then ran npm run test to determine if the test passed on not, the test didn't pass; so I fixed the js folders and ran the test again and it passed.

On the app.js folder, I coded all the functions and created output and team html. I console.log to create the html file.

## Below is the solution:
